4. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that you’ve completed this one.

Answer: [This was a bit more difficult than the previous assignment. I am still having issues reading the problems effectively and understanding what is being asked. I am confident I can solve more problems like this using the same techniques.

It would be nice if test cases were clearly defined with the functions that are pre-made as a part of the problems. I also still personally think it's valuable to write plainly something like: "Complete the below function - it is expected to take x arguments, and it is for this purpose, expected return values, etc."]
